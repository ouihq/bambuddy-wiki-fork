## :material-archive: How Archiving Works

!!! warning "SD Card Required"
    An SD card must be inserted in your printer for archiving to work. Bambuddy downloads the 3MF file from the printer's SD card after each print completes.

When a print completes:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Print Completes] --> B[Download 3MF]
    B --> C[Extract Metadata]
    C --> D[Generate Thumbnail]
    D --> E[Check Duplicates]
    E --> F[Save to Archive]
```

### What Gets Archived

| Data | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **3MF File** | Complete print file from printer |
| **Thumbnail** | Preview image from slicer |
| **Metadata** | Print settings, layers, filament, etc. |
| **Print result** | Success, failed, or stopped |
| **Duration** | Actual print time |
| **Filament used** | Grams consumed |
| **Camera snapshot** | Photo at completion (if enabled) |

### What Gets Skipped

Bambuddy automatically skips archiving for:

- **Calibration prints** — Internal printer operations like flow rate calibration, vibration compensation, and bed leveling (gcode files under `/usr/` on the printer)
- **Prints with auto-archive disabled** — Per-printer toggle in printer settings

## :material-cube-scan: 3D Model Preview

View your models directly in the browser:

### Three.js Viewer

- **Rotate** - Click and drag
- **Zoom** - Scroll wheel
- **Pan** - Right-click and drag
- **Reset** - Double-click

### Viewer Features

- Color from slicer
- Multi-part support

### Plate Selector

For multi-plate 3MF files, the viewer includes a plate selector panel:

- **Thumbnail Grid** - Visual preview of each plate
- **Object Count** - Shows how many objects are on each plate
- **"All Plates" Option** - View all plates combined (default)
- **Individual Selection** - Click a plate to view just that plate's objects

### Fullscreen Mode

Click the fullscreen button in the modal header for an immersive viewing experience:

- **Resizable Split View** - Drag the divider between the plate panel and 3D viewer
- **Pagination** - For files with many plates, pagination controls appear automatically
- **Responsive Layout** - Plate grid adjusts columns based on available width

### Object Count Display

The header shows the total object count across all plates, or the count for the selected plate:

- **All Plates**: Shows total objects (e.g., "All Plates: 15 objects")
- **Single Plate Selected**: Shows that plate's count (e.g., "Plate 1: 5 objects")

---

## :material-content-duplicate: Duplicate Detection

Bambuddy automatically detects duplicate prints:

### How It Works

1. Extracts file hash from 3MF
2. Compares with existing archives
3. Marks potential duplicates
4. You decide what to keep

### Duplicate Indicators

- Badge showing "Duplicate"
- Link to original print
- Side-by-side comparison available

### Managing Duplicates

- **Keep both** - Sometimes you intentionally reprint
- **Delete duplicate** - Remove the newer one

---

## :material-card-text: Archive Cards

Each archive displays as a card with key information:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Thumbnail]                           │
│                                        │
│  Benchy.3mf                           │
│  Workshop X1C • 2h 15m                │
│  ✓ Success • 45g PLA                  │
│                                        │
│  [Tags] [Project Badge]               │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Card Information

- **Thumbnail** - Visual preview
- **Filename** - Original file name
- **Printer** - Which printer completed it
- **Duration** - How long it took
- **Result** - Success, failed, or stopped
- **Filament** - Material and weight used
- **Object Count** - Number of printable objects in the 3MF
- **Tags** - Custom labels
- **Project** - Assigned project badge
- **Uploaded by** - Username who uploaded (when authentication is enabled)

### Card Action Buttons

Each archive card has action buttons at the bottom for quick access:

| Button | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Reprint** | Print immediately on a connected printer |
| **Schedule** | Add to print queue (schedule for later) |
| :material-open-in-new: | Open in Slicer (Bambu Studio or OrcaSlicer — configurable in Settings) |
| :material-web: | Open external link (if set) |

| :material-pencil: | Edit archive details |

!!! note "Permission Required"
    The Schedule button requires the `queue:create` permission. Users without this permission will see the button disabled.

### Context Menu Button

Each card has a three-dot menu button (⋮) that appears on hover:

- Provides quick access to all context menu actions
- Always visible on mobile devices
- Located on the left side of the card

### Multi-Plate Browsing

For archives created from multi-plate 3MF files, you can browse through each plate's thumbnail directly on the card:

1. **Hover** over the archive card to reveal navigation controls
2. **Arrow buttons** (◀ ▶) on left/right to cycle through plates
3. **Dot indicators** at bottom show current plate (clickable)
4. Each plate shows its individual thumbnail preview

!!! tip "Lazy Loading"
    Plate data is only fetched when you hover over the card, keeping the archives page fast even with many archives.

## :material-view-grid: View Modes

Switch between different archive views using the toolbar buttons:

### Grid View (Cards)

Default view showing archive cards in a responsive grid:

- Large thumbnails for visual browsing
- All metadata visible at a glance
- Best for visual identification

### List View

Compact table view for data-focused browsing:

- One archive per row
- Sortable columns
- Inline edit and delete buttons
- Three-dot menu for full context menu access
- Best for managing large archives

### Calendar View

Browse archives by date:

## :material-printer-3d: Re-print with AMS Mapping

When re-printing an archive, Bambuddy shows a filament comparison with auto-matching and manual override options:

![Re-print AMS Mapping](../assets/reprint_ams_mapping.png){ .screenshot }

### What It Shows

| Required (from 3MF) | → | Loaded (in AMS) | Status |
|---------------------|---|-----------------|--------|
| PLA Red (25g) | → | PLA Red (AMS-A Slot 1) | ✓ Match |
| PETG Black (10g) | → | PETG White (AMS-B Slot 2) | ⚠ Color mismatch |
| PLA Blue (5g) | → | TPU (AMS-A Slot 3) | ⚠ Type mismatch |

### Status Indicators

| Icon | Color | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| ✓ | Green | Type and color both match (exact or similar) |
| ⚠ | Yellow | Same type, different color |
| ⚠ | Orange | Different filament type or not loaded |

### Features

- **Auto-Matching** - Automatically finds the best AMS slot for each required filament (type + color)
- **Manual Slot Selection** - Click the dropdown to override auto-matching and select any AMS slot
- **Color Names** - Dropdown shows color names (decoded from Bambu filament codes like "Jade White", "Cobalt Blue", or derived from hex for third-party filaments)
- **Blue Ring Indicator** - Shows which slots have been manually selected vs auto-matched
- **AMS Slot Labels** - Shows which AMS unit and slot contains the filament (e.g., "AMS-B Slot 3")
- **Fuzzy Color Matching** - Colors are matched within a tolerance, so slight hex variations still show as a match
- **Re-read Button** - Refresh AMS status from the printer if you've swapped spools since the modal opened

### Multi-Plate 3MF Files

When reprinting a multi-plate 3MF file (exported from Bambu Studio with "All sliced file"), Bambuddy shows a plate selection grid:

- **Plate Thumbnails** - Visual preview of each plate to help identify the correct one
- **Plate Names** - Shows object names and print time estimates
- **Filtered Filaments** - Only filaments used by the selected plate are shown for mapping
- **Required Selection** - You must select a plate before printing

This prevents the issue where all plates' filaments were shown together, causing incorrect AMS mapping.

!!! tip "Single-Plate Exports"
    For 3MF files exported as a single plate ("Plate sliced file"), the plate is auto-selected and no grid is shown.

### Print Options

Click **Print Options** to configure settings before starting:

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Bed Leveling** | Enabled | Auto-level bed before print |
| **Flow Calibration** | Disabled | Calibrate extrusion flow |
| **Vibration Calibration** | Enabled | Reduce ringing artifacts |
| **First Layer Inspection** | Disabled | AI inspection of first layer |
| **Timelapse** | Disabled | Record timelapse video |

!!! tip "Multi-Color Prints"
    Bambuddy sends AMS mapping in the same format as Bambu Studio, ensuring reliable filament switching on multi-color prints.

### How It Works

1. Click **Re-print** on an archive
2. Select target printer
3. **For multi-plate files**: Select which plate to print from the grid
4. Review filament comparison (click **Re-read** if you've changed spools)
5. Expand **Print Options** to adjust settings if needed
6. Click **Print** to start

!!! tip "File Type Badge"
    Archive cards show a **GCODE** (green) or **SOURCE** (orange) badge. Only GCODE files have AMS mapping data - SOURCE files are slicer project files without embedded print settings.

## :material-image-multiple: Photo Attachments

Add photos to your archives:

### Camera Snapshot

Automatic camera capture on print completion:

1. Go to **Settings** > **General**
2. Enable **Capture snapshot on print complete**
3. Photos are automatically added to archives

### Manual Photos

Upload photos of your finished prints:

1. Open an archive

## :material-movie-edit: Timelapse Editor

Edit your timelapse videos directly in Bambuddy:

![Timelapse Editor](../assets/edit-timelapse.png){ .screenshot }

### Supported Formats

| Format | Printers | Handling |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **MP4** | X1, X1C, X1E, A1, A1 Mini, H2D | Attached directly |
| **AVI** | P1S, P1P | Saved immediately, converted to MP4 in the background |

!!! info "Background Conversion"
    AVI files from P1-series printers are converted to MP4 automatically using FFmpeg. The conversion runs at low CPU priority (`-threads 1`, `nice -n 19`) to avoid impacting performance on Raspberry Pi. The timelapse is available immediately after the print — the conversion happens silently in the background.

### Opening the Editor

1. Open an archive with a timelapse
2. Click the timelapse to view it
3. Click **Edit** in the viewer header

### Editor Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Trim** | Set start and end points with visual timeline |

| **Music** | Add audio overlay with volume control |
| **Preview** | Preview changes before saving |

### Timeline Controls

- **Thumbnail strip** - Visual preview of video frames
- **Trim handles** - Drag to set start/end points
- **Playhead** - Shows current position
- **Play/Pause** - Preview trimmed section

### Adding Music

1. Click the **Music** section
2. Upload an audio file (MP3, WAV, M4A, AAC, OGG)
3. Adjust volume with the slider
4. Preview synced with video playback

### Saving Changes

Click **Save** to process the video. The original timelapse will be replaced with the edited version.

!!! note "Processing Time"
    Video processing uses FFmpeg on the server. Longer videos may take a few moments to process.

### Manual Timelapse Upload & Remove

If the auto-scan attaches the wrong timelapse or your printer is in LAN-only mode:

1. **Remove** the incorrect timelapse via the context menu → **Remove Timelapse**
2. **Upload** the correct file via the context menu → **Upload Timelapse**

| Action | When Visible | Description |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Upload Timelapse** | No timelapse attached | Upload `.mp4`, `.avi`, or `.mkv` from your device |
| **Remove Timelapse** | Timelapse attached | Delete the timelapse and clear the reference |

!!! tip "AVI Auto-Conversion"
    Uploaded AVI and MKV files are automatically converted to MP4 in the background, just like auto-scanned timelapses.
