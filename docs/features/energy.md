# Energy Tracking

Track power consumption from your 3D printers and calculate electricity costs per print or cumulatively.

---

## :material-lightning-bolt: Overview

Energy tracking helps you understand:

- **Power consumption** per print
- **Electricity costs** over time
- **Most efficient** printers and settings
- **Total energy** usage

---

## :material-power-plug: Requirements

Energy tracking requires a smart plug with power monitoring:

### Supported Smart Plugs

| Type | Power Monitoring | Notes |
|------|:----------------:|-------|
| **Tasmota** | :material-check: | Direct HTTP API |
| **Home Assistant** | :material-check: | Via HA sensors |

!!! info "Home Assistant Energy Sensors"
    Many HA plugs expose energy data as separate sensor entities. Configure these in the plug settings under **Energy Monitoring (Optional)**. See [Smart Plugs](smart-plugs.md) for setup.

---

## :material-cog: Configuration

### Setting Up Energy Tracking

1. Configure a smart plug for your printer (Tasmota or Home Assistant)
2. Go to **Settings** > **Smart Plugs**
3. Assign the plug to a printer
4. For HA plugs: Configure energy sensor entities if needed
5. Energy tracking starts automatically

### Tracking Mode

Choose how energy is tracked:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Per Print** | Track energy for each individual print |
| **Total** | Track cumulative energy usage |

Configure in **Settings** > **General**.

---

## :material-meter-electric: Energy Data

### Per-Print Tracking

When enabled, each print records:

| Data | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Energy (Wh)** | Watt-hours consumed |
| **Peak Power (W)** | Maximum power draw |
| **Avg Power (W)** | Average during print |
| **Cost** | Calculated electricity cost |

### Archive Display

Energy data appears on archive cards:

```
⚡ 245 Wh • $0.04
```

---

## :material-chart-line: Energy Statistics

### Dashboard Widget

The Energy widget shows:

- **Total consumption** for period
- **Cost breakdown** by printer
- **Trend over time**
- **Comparison** between printers

### Energy by Printer

| Printer | Total Energy | Avg per Print | Cost |
|---------|:------------:|:-------------:|:----:|
| Workshop X1C | 15.2 kWh | 380 Wh | $2.28 |
| Office P1S | 8.5 kWh | 425 Wh | $1.28 |

---

## :material-cash: Cost Calculation

### Setting Electricity Rate

1. Go to **Settings** > **General**
2. Find **Electricity Cost**
3. Enter your rate per kWh
4. Choose currency

### Cost Formula

```
Print Cost = (Energy in Wh / 1000) × Rate per kWh
```

**Example:**
```
245 Wh at $0.15/kWh = 0.245 × 0.15 = $0.037
```

## :material-clock-start: When Energy is Tracked

Energy tracking records:

| Phase | Tracked? |
|-------|:--------:|
| Preheating | :material-check: |
| Printing | :material-check: |
| Cooling | :material-check: |
| Idle (printer on, not printing) | Depends on mode |

### Per-Print Mode

Only tracks during active print:

- Starts when print begins
- Ends when print completes
- Includes preheating and cooling

### Total Mode

Tracks all energy when printer is on:

- Cumulative total
- Includes idle time
- Resets on demand

---

## :material-file-export: Energy Export

Export energy data:

1. Go to **Statistics**
2. Click **Export**
3. Energy data included in CSV/Excel

Export includes:

- Per-print energy consumption
- Cost calculations
- Printer comparison data

---

## :material-chart-bar: Energy Analysis

### Efficient Settings

Compare energy usage across prints to find efficient settings:

| Setting | Energy Impact |
|---------|---------------|
| Lower temps | Less energy |
| Faster prints | Less energy (shorter runtime) |
| PLA vs ABS | ABS uses more (higher temps) |
| Enclosed chamber | Uses more (chamber heating) |

### Printer Efficiency

Compare printers:

- Some are more efficient than others
- Consider energy when choosing which printer to use
- Factor into total cost of ownership

---

## :material-poll: Total Cost of Printing

Combine energy costs with filament costs:

```
Total Print Cost = Filament Cost + Electricity Cost
```

**Example:**
```
Filament: 45g at $25/kg = $1.13
Electricity: 245 Wh at $0.15/kWh = $0.04
───────────────────────────────────
Total: $1.17
```

## :material-lightbulb: Tips

!!! tip "Accurate Rates"
    Use your actual electricity rate from your utility bill, including all fees and taxes.

!!! tip "Compare Printers"
    Track energy to understand which printer is most cost-effective for different jobs.

!!! tip "Factor in Failures"
    Failed prints still consume energy - another reason to optimize for reliability.

!!! tip "Peak Hours"
    If your electricity has time-of-use rates, schedule prints during off-peak hours.

!!! tip "Standby Power"
    Consider auto power-off to eliminate standby energy consumption.

## :material-home-automation: Dynamic Electricity Rates

If you have a dynamic electricity tariff (e.g., Tibber, Octopus Energy), you can automatically update the electricity rate from Home Assistant.

### How It Works

Home Assistant pushes the current electricity price to Bambuddy's API whenever it changes. This ensures cost calculations always use the current rate.

### Setup

#### 1. Create an API Key

1. Go to **Settings** > **API Keys**
2. Create a key with **Write Settings** permission
3. Copy the key

#### 2. Add REST Command to Home Assistant

Add to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
rest_command:
  bambuddy_electricity_price:
    url: "http://YOUR_BAMBUDDY_IP:8000/api/v1/settings"
    method: PATCH
    headers:
      X-API-Key: "YOUR_API_KEY"
    content_type: "application/json"
    payload: '{"energy_cost_per_kwh": {{ states("sensor.electricity_price") }}}'
```

Replace:

- `YOUR_BAMBUDDY_IP` with your Bambuddy server address
- `YOUR_API_KEY` with the API key from step 1
- `sensor.electricity_price` with your energy provider's price sensor

#### 3. Create Automation

```yaml
automation:
  id: 'bambuddy_push_electricity_price'
  alias: "Update Bambuddy Electricity Price"
  mode: restart
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: sensor.electricity_price
      for: "00:00:05"
  condition:
    - condition: template
      value_template: >
        {{ states('sensor.electricity_price')|float(none) is not none }}
  action:
    - delay: "00:00:01"
    - service: rest_command.bambuddy_electricity_price
```

This updates the price in Bambuddy whenever your electricity rate changes.

### Common Energy Provider Sensors

| Provider | Typical Sensor |
|----------|----------------|
| Tibber | `sensor.tibber_prices` |
| Octopus Energy | `sensor.octopus_energy_electricity_current_rate` |
| Nordpool | `sensor.nordpool_kwh_*` |

!!! tip "Check Your Sensor"
    Verify your sensor returns a numeric value (e.g., `0.25`) not a string with currency symbol.
