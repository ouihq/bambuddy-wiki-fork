## :material-cloud: Overview

Bambu Cloud Profiles lets you:

- **View** your cloud slicer presets
- **Compare** template differences
- **Manage** visibility and organization
- **Track** preset versions

---

## :material-key: Authentication

### Connecting to Bambu Cloud

1. Go to **Cloud Profiles** page
2. Click **Connect to Bambu Cloud**
3. Enter your Bambu Cloud credentials
4. Click **Login**
5. Complete 2FA verification (see below)

!!! info "Multi-User Instances"
    When [authentication](authentication.md) is enabled, each user has their own independent Bambu Cloud login. Your cloud credentials are stored on your user account — logging in or out does not affect other users. The `cloud:auth` permission is required to use Cloud Profiles.

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Bambuddy supports both types of Bambu Cloud 2FA:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Email Verification** | A 6-digit code is sent to your email |
| **TOTP (Authenticator App)** | Use your authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.) |

The login flow automatically detects which method your account uses:

- **Email**: You'll see "Verification code sent to your email"
- **TOTP**: You'll see "Enter code from your authenticator app"

!!! tip "TOTP Recommended"
    If you have an authenticator app set up on your Bambu account, the login will be faster since you don't need to wait for an email.

### Access Token Login

If email/password login doesn't work for you (e.g., SSO account, region issues), you can log in using a Bambu Cloud access token:

1. Click **Use access token instead** on the login page
2. Obtain your access token using one of the methods below
3. Paste it into Bambuddy and click **Set Token**

#### How to Obtain an Access Token

The access token is retrieved by authenticating via the Bambu Lab API (it is **not** available in the Bambu Studio UI). Common methods:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Python script** (recommended) | Use a library like [`bambu-lab-cloud-api`](https://pypi.org/project/bambu-lab-cloud-api/) to handle the login flow — it sends your credentials, prompts for the email verification code, and returns the token |
| **Manual API call** | POST to `https://api.bambulab.com/v1/user-service/user/login` with your email/password, complete email verification, and extract the `accessToken` from the response |

!!! info "Token details"
    - The token is typically valid for **3 months**
    - Scripts often save it to a local file (e.g., `~/.bambu_token`) for reuse
    - This is the **Cloud Access Token** (for API/MQTT) — do not confuse it with the **Printer Access Code** (found on the printer screen under Network settings, used for local LAN connections only)

!!! tip "When to use token login"
    Access token login is useful when email/2FA login fails or when your Bambu account uses a third-party SSO provider that Bambuddy can't authenticate against directly.

!!! note "Credentials Storage"
    Credentials are stored locally and only used to access your presets.

## :material-help-circle: Troubleshooting

### Authentication Failed

1. Verify credentials are correct
2. Check internet connection
3. Ensure Bambu Cloud is accessible
4. Try logging out and back in
5. For TOTP: Ensure your device time is synchronized (TOTP codes are time-based)
6. If all else fails, try the **access token** method instead (see [Access Token Login](#access-token-login))

### TOTP Code Not Working

1. Check your device time is accurate (enable automatic time sync)
2. Make sure you're using the correct account in your authenticator app
3. Try waiting for a new code (codes expire every 30 seconds)
4. If persistent, try disabling and re-enabling TOTP on your Bambu account

### Profiles Not Showing

1. Click **Sync** to refresh
2. Check filters aren't hiding profiles
3. Verify cloud account has profiles
4. Check connection status

### Sync Issues

1. Check network connectivity
2. Try manual sync
3. Re-authenticate if needed
4. Check Bambu Cloud status
