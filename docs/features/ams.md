# AMS & Humidity Monitoring

Bambuddy provides comprehensive monitoring for your AMS (Automatic Material System) and AMS-HT (High Temperature) units.

---

## :material-tray-full: AMS Slot Status

Each AMS slot displays:

| Information | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Filament color** | Visual color swatch |
| **Material type** | PLA, PETG, ABS, ASA, etc. |
| **Remaining** | Estimated filament left |
| **Active** | Currently feeding indicator |

### RFID Re-read

Refresh filament information for individual AMS slots:

1. Hover over an AMS slot on the printer card
2. Click the menu button (:material-dots-vertical:) that appears
3. Select **Re-read RFID**
4. A loading indicator appears while the printer reads the RFID tag
5. Filament information updates automatically when complete

!!! note "Availability"
    The re-read menu is hidden when the printer is busy (printing). Wait until the printer is idle to re-read RFID data.

!!! tip "When to Re-read"
    Use this feature when you've swapped a spool but the AMS hasn't automatically detected the change, or if filament information seems incorrect.

### Configure AMS Slot

Manually configure AMS slots for third-party or generic filaments. This tells the printer which filament profile to use for a specific slot (temperatures, flow rate, pressure advance).

1. Hover over an AMS slot on the printer card
2. Click the menu button (:material-dots-vertical:) that appears
3. Select **Configure Slot**
4. Choose a filament preset (from Bambu Cloud, local OrcaSlicer imports, or the built-in Bambu filament catalog — see [preset sources](inventory.md#where-presets-come-from))
5. Select a matching K profile (pressure advance calibration)
6. Optionally set a custom color using the color picker
7. Click **Configure Slot** to apply

**Color Picker Features:**

- 8 basic colors shown by default (White, Black, Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Gray)
- Click **+** to expand 24 additional colors
- Enter custom hex codes or color names (e.g., "brown", "FF8800")
- Live preview of selected color

!!! tip "User Presets"
    User presets that inherit from Bambu presets (e.g., "# Overture Matte PLA @BBL H2D") are fully supported. Bambuddy automatically derives the correct filament ID from the preset's base configuration.

#### Printer Model Filtering

Filament presets in the Configure AMS Slot modal are automatically filtered by the printer model. This means you only see presets that are compatible with the printer you are configuring:

- **Cloud presets** are matched by the model suffix in the preset name (e.g., `@BBL X1C`, `@BBL P1S`, `@BBL H2D`). Generic presets without a model suffix are always included.
- **Local presets** are filtered by their `compatible_printers` field to show only those that list the current printer model.
- The **currently-configured preset** for the slot is always shown in the list, regardless of model filter, so you can see what is already set even if the preset would otherwise be filtered out.

This filtering reduces clutter and prevents accidentally selecting a preset intended for a different printer.

#### Pre-Population for Configured Slots

When you open the Configure AMS Slot modal for a slot that already has a configuration, Bambuddy pre-populates the form fields so you can review or adjust the current settings without starting from scratch:

- **Filament preset** — The previously-configured preset is pre-selected. Bambuddy resolves this from the saved preset mapping or by matching the slot's `tray_info_idx` to the corresponding preset.
- **Color** — The color picker is pre-populated with the slot's current filament color.
- **K-profile** — The active pressure advance profile is pre-selected by matching the slot's `cali_idx` to the available K-profile entries.
- **Auto-scroll** — The preset list automatically scrolls to the selected item so it is visible without manual scrolling.

!!! tip "Quick Adjustments"
    Pre-population makes it easy to tweak a single setting (for example, updating just the color or K-profile) without re-selecting every field from scratch.

### Multi-AMS Support

Bambuddy supports multiple AMS units per printer:

- Up to 4 AMS units (16 total slots)
- Each unit displayed with its slots
- Visual indication of active slot during printing

#### External Spool Holders

Printers without an AMS (or with filament loaded outside the AMS) use an external spool holder. The H2D is a dual-nozzle printer with two external spool positions — **Ext-L** (left) and **Ext-R** (right) — each feeding its respective nozzle. Bambuddy displays both external slots and supports configuring, color-setting, and K-profile assignment for each one independently.

## :material-water-percent: Humidity Monitoring

Track humidity levels inside your AMS units:

### Current Reading

The humidity percentage is displayed on the printer card:

| Level | Status | Action |
|:-----:|--------|--------|
| < 20% | :material-check-circle:{ style="color: #4caf50" } Excellent | None needed |
| 20-40% | :material-check-circle:{ style="color: #8bc34a" } Good | None needed |
| 40-60% | :material-alert:{ style="color: #ff9800" } Fair | Consider drying |
| > 60% | :material-alert-circle:{ style="color: #f44336" } High | Replace desiccant |

### Configurable Thresholds

Set custom warning thresholds in Settings:

1. Go to **Settings** > **General**
2. Find **AMS Humidity Threshold**
3. Set your preferred warning level
4. Save changes

!!! tip "Filament Sensitivity"
    Different filaments have different humidity sensitivities. PLA is more tolerant than Nylon or PETG.

---

## :material-thermometer: Temperature Monitoring

For AMS-HT (High Temperature) units, temperature is also tracked:

| Reading | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Current temp** | Live temperature inside the unit |
| **Target temp** | Configured drying temperature |
| **Status** | Heating, holding, or idle |

---

## :material-fire: Remote AMS Drying

Control AMS drying directly from Bambuddy — no need to use the printer's touchscreen. Start, monitor, and stop drying sessions for AMS 2 Pro and AMS-HT units.

### Supported Hardware

Remote drying requires an AMS unit with built-in heating:

| AMS Type | Module Type | Max Temp | Supported |
|----------|:-----------:|:--------:|:---------:|
| AMS 2 Pro | n3f | 65°C | :material-check: |
| AMS-HT | n3s | 85°C | :material-check: |
| AMS (original) | ams | — | :material-close: |

### Printer Firmware Requirements

Not all printers support remote drying commands. The following minimum firmware versions are required:

| Printer Model | Min Firmware | Notes |
|---------------|:------------:|-------|
| X1 / X1C | 01.09.00.00 | |
| P1P / P1S | 01.08.00.00 | |
| H2D | 01.02.30.00 | |
| H2D Pro | Any | No version gate |
| X1E | Any | No version gate |
| P2S, A1, A1 Mini | — | :material-close: Not supported |
| H2S, H2C | — | :material-close: Not supported |

!!! note "Unknown Models"
    For printers not listed above (future models), Bambuddy allows the drying command. If the printer's firmware doesn't support it, the command fails gracefully with no side effects.

### Starting a Drying Session

1. Find the AMS 2 Pro or AMS-HT card on the Printers page
2. Click the :material-fire: flame icon in the AMS card header
3. In the drying popover:
      - **Select filament type** — Choose from PLA, PETG, TPU, ABS, ASA, PA, PC, or PVA
      - **Temperature** — Auto-set from BambuStudio official presets; adjust manually with the slider or input field
      - **Duration** — Auto-set from presets (1–24 hours); adjust as needed
4. Click **Start**

!!! tip "Filament Presets"
    Temperature and duration values are sourced from BambuStudio's official filament drying profiles. Selecting a filament type auto-fills the recommended temperature and duration for your AMS type (n3f and n3s have different limits).

### Monitoring Drying Progress

When drying is active, a status bar appears between the AMS header and slot grid:

- **Time remaining** — Countdown in hours and minutes (e.g., "3h 42m" or "42m")
- The flame icon in the header turns amber to indicate active drying

### Stopping a Drying Session

- Click the **×** button on the drying status bar, or
- Click the flame icon (when drying is active, it acts as a stop button)

### Permissions

| Action | Required Permission |
|--------|:------------------:|
| View drying status | No permission needed |
| Start / Stop drying | `printers:control` |

!!! warning "Drying During Prints"
    The AMS can dry filament while the printer is idle or printing. However, drying during a print may affect the AMS temperature readings and humidity levels.

## :material-fire: AMS-HT vs Standard AMS

| Feature | Standard AMS | AMS-HT |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Humidity monitoring | :material-check: | :material-check: |
| Temperature monitoring | :material-close: | :material-check: |
| [Remote drying](#remote-ams-drying) | :material-close: | :material-check: |
| High-temp filaments | :material-close: | :material-check: |

### AMS-HT Temperature Control

AMS-HT units can actively dry filament. See [Remote AMS Drying](#remote-ams-drying) for setup and usage.

---

## :material-label: Custom AMS Labels

Assign friendly names to your AMS units to easily identify them in multi-AMS setups.

### AMS Info Card

Hover over any AMS label (e.g. "AMS-A") on the Printers page to see a popover with:

- **Serial Number** — The hardware serial from MQTT
- **Firmware Version** — Parsed from the printer's `get_version` response
- **Friendly Name** — An editable text field for your custom label

### Setting a Custom Label

1. Hover over the AMS label on the Printers page
2. Type a name in the "AMS Name" field (e.g. "Silk Colours", "Workshop AMS")
3. Click **Save** or press **Enter**
4. To remove a label, clear the field and save, or click **Clear**

!!! note "Permission Required"
    Editing AMS labels requires the `printers:update` permission when authentication is enabled.

### Label Persistence

Labels are stored by AMS serial number, so they **persist when the AMS is moved to a different printer**. If the AMS serial is not available (older firmware), a fallback key based on printer ID and AMS position is used.

Custom labels also appear in the **Inventory page** location column alongside the slot identifier, making it easy to find spools across a print farm.

### Slot Numbers

Each filament color circle now displays a 1-based slot number with automatically inverted text contrast — black text on light filaments, white text on dark filaments.

## :material-lan: AMS Discovery

Bambuddy automatically discovers connected AMS units:

- Detected during printer connection
- Updates when AMS configuration changes
- No manual configuration needed

### Dual-Nozzle Wiring

For H2D and other dual-nozzle printers, Bambuddy displays the AMS wiring configuration:

- Which AMS units feed which nozzle
- Visual diagram of connections
- Helps plan multi-material prints

### Nozzle-Aware Filament Mapping

On dual-nozzle printers (H2D, H2D Pro), each AMS unit is physically connected to either the left or right nozzle. When a 3MF file assigns filaments to specific nozzles, Bambuddy constrains filament matching to only AMS trays connected to the correct nozzle.

**How it works:**

1. The 3MF file contains `filament_nozzle_map` and `physical_extruder_map` in `project_settings.config`, mapping each filament slot to a target nozzle (0 = right, 1 = left)
2. The printer reports `ams_extruder_map` via MQTT, indicating which AMS unit feeds which nozzle
3. When matching filaments to AMS slots, only trays on the correct nozzle are considered
4. If no trays exist on the target nozzle, matching falls back to the full tray list

This applies to:

- **Print scheduler** — automatic filament matching for queued prints
- **Reprint modal** — filament mapping when reprinting from archives
- **Queue modal** — filament mapping when adding to queue
- **Multi-printer selection** — per-printer mapping for print farms

The filament mapping UI shows **L** (left) and **R** (right) badges next to each filament requirement for dual-nozzle prints.

!!! note "Single-Nozzle Printers"
    On single-nozzle printers (X1C, P1S, A1, etc.), nozzle filtering is not applied. All AMS trays are available for matching as before.

## :material-sync: Spoolman Integration

Sync AMS slots with Spoolman for complete filament tracking:

1. Configure Spoolman integration in Settings
2. AMS slots sync automatically
3. Track usage across your inventory

## :material-lightbulb: Tips

!!! tip "Desiccant Maintenance"
    When humidity consistently stays high, it's time to replace or regenerate your desiccant packets.

!!! tip "Filament Storage"
    For filaments not in the AMS, store in vacuum bags with desiccant to maintain low humidity.

!!! tip "Historical Analysis"
    Review humidity charts to understand how your environment affects filament condition over time.

!!! tip "AMS-HT for Hygroscopic Filaments"
    Consider AMS-HT for moisture-sensitive materials like Nylon, PC, and PETG.
