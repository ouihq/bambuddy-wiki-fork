2. Add your filaments:
   - Material type
   - Color
   - **Cost per kg**
   - Vendor (optional)
3. Statistics calculate costs automatically

### Cost Calculation

```
Print Cost = (Filament Used in grams / 1000) × Cost per kg
```

### Recalculate Costs

If you change your default filament cost, existing archives retain their original calculated costs. To update all archives with current pricing:

1. Click **Recalculate Costs** in the dashboard header
2. All archive costs are recalculated using current filament prices
3. Statistics update immediately

!!! info "Reprint Costs"
    When you reprint an archive, the cost is **added** to the existing total. This ensures statistics accurately reflect total filament expenditure across all prints of the same file.
