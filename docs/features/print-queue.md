# Print Queue

Queue and schedule prints with drag-and-drop ordering, timed starts, and smart plug automation.

![Queue Page](../assets/print-queue.png){ .screenshot }

---

## :material-playlist-plus: Queue Overview

The print queue lets you:

- **Queue prints** from your archive
- **Order** with drag-and-drop
- **Schedule** specific start times
- **Automate** with smart plug integration
- **Track** queue progress

!!! warning "SD Card Required"
    An SD card must be inserted in your printer for the print queue to work. Files are transferred to the printer's SD card when prints start.

---

## :material-plus: Adding to Queue

### From Archive

1. Go to **Archives** page
2. Click the **Schedule** button on the archive card (or right-click and select **Schedule**)
3. Choose target printer
4. Optionally configure filament mapping (see below)
5. Print is added to queue

!!! tip "Quick Access"
    The **Schedule** button appears directly on archive cards next to **Reprint** for sliced files, making it easy to queue prints without using the context menu.

### From File Manager

1. Go to **File Manager** page
2. Select sliced files (`.gcode` or `.gcode.3mf`)
3. Click **Add to Queue** in toolbar (or right-click context menu)
4. Choose target printer (or leave unassigned)
5. Files are archived and queued automatically

### From Queue Page

1. Go to **Queue** page
2. Click **Add Print**
3. Browse and select an archive
4. Choose target printer
5. Optionally set schedule time
6. Optionally configure filament mapping

### From Virtual Printer

When a virtual printer is set to **Print Queue** mode, prints sent from your slicer are automatically archived and added to the queue. The virtual printer's **Auto-dispatch** setting controls what happens next:

- **Enabled** (default): Incoming prints start automatically when a printer is available
- **Disabled**: Prints are added to the queue but require manual dispatch

[:material-arrow-right: Virtual Printer setup](virtual-printer.md)

### AMS Filament Mapping

When adding multi-color prints to the queue, you can configure which AMS slot to use for each filament:

1. Expand the **Filament Mapping** section
2. View auto-matched filaments (type + color)
3. Click any dropdown to manually select a different AMS slot
4. Color names shown for easy identification (decoded from Bambu filament codes)
5. Mapping is stored with the queued print

**Dual-Nozzle Printers (H2D/H2D Pro):**

On dual-nozzle printers, filament matching is nozzle-aware. Each filament requirement shows an **L** or **R** badge indicating which nozzle it targets. Auto-matching only considers AMS trays connected to the correct nozzle via `ams_extruder_map`. This prevents sending filament meant for the left nozzle to the right one and vice versa.

!!! tip "Stored Mappings"
    AMS mappings are saved when you add a print to the queue. When the print starts, Bambuddy uses your configured mapping instead of auto-matching again.

### Plate Selection (Multi-Plate 3MF)

For 3MF files with multiple plates:

1. Click **Edit** on a queued item
2. Scroll to **Plate Selection** section
3. Browse plates with thumbnails and print times
4. Click to select the plate to print
5. Filament requirements update to show selected plate's filaments

!!! tip "Queue All Plates"
    When adding a multi-plate 3MF file to the queue, a **"Queue All N Plates"** toggle appears in the plate selector. Activating it adds every plate as a separate queue entry (one per plate per selected printer), each individually editable after creation. This toggle is only available in add-to-queue mode.

!!! tip "Single Plate per Queue Item"
    Each queue item prints one plate. To print multiple plates from the same file, add the file to queue multiple times and select different plates, or use the "Queue All Plates" toggle above.

### Print Options

Configure printer settings for each queued print:

1. Click **Edit** on a queued item
2. Expand **Print Options** section
3. Toggle options as needed:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Bed Levelling | Auto-level bed before print |
| Flow Calibration | Calibrate flow before print |
| Vibration Calibration | Reduce vibration artifacts |
| Layer Inspect | Enable AI first layer inspection |
| Timelapse | Record timelapse video |
| Use AMS | Use AMS system for filament |

!!! tip "Default Settings"
    Default values match typical printing needs. Adjust only if your print requires specific settings.

---

## :material-drag: Drag and Drop Ordering

Reorder prints in the queue:

1. Hover over a queued print
2. Grab the drag handle :material-drag:
3. Drag to new position
4. Release to reorder

Prints execute in order from top to bottom.

---

## :material-clock-outline: Scheduling

### Immediate Prints

Add to queue without a schedule - prints start when:

- Printer is idle
- Previous prints complete
- No scheduled prints are pending

### Scheduled Prints

Set a specific start time:

1. Click **Schedule** on queued print
2. Choose date and time
3. Print starts at scheduled time

### Schedule Priority

Scheduled prints take priority:

1. Check for scheduled prints at scheduled time
2. If none, check immediate queue
3. Start next print

### Queue Only (Staged Prints)

Stage prints without automatic scheduling:

1. When adding to queue, select **Queue Only**
2. Print shows with purple **Staged** badge
3. Print won't start automatically
4. Click :material-play: **Play** button to release to queue

Use Queue Only to:

- Prepare print batches before activating
- Stage prints across multiple printers
- Review and approve before printing starts
- Build a queue without immediate execution

!!! tip "Batch Workflow"
    Add multiple prints with Queue Only, review the order, then release them one by one or all at once.

---

## :material-power: Smart Plug Automation

Combine with smart plugs for full automation:

### Auto Power On

When a queued print is ready:

1. Bambuddy checks if printer is on
2. If off and smart plug configured, powers on
3. Waits for printer to boot
4. Starts the print

### Auto Power Off

After print completes:

1. Print completes
2. Cooldown period (configurable)
3. Check if more prints queued
4. If no more prints, power off

### Configuration

1. Go to **Settings** > **Smart Plugs**
2. Configure plug for printer
3. Enable **Auto Power On** and **Auto Power Off**
4. Set cooldown temperature and time

[:material-arrow-right: Smart Plugs setup](smart-plugs.md)

## :material-format-list-checks: Queue Status

### Print States

| State | Icon | Description |
|-------|:----:|-------------|
| Queued | :material-clock-outline: | Waiting in queue |
| Scheduled | :material-calendar-clock: | Waiting for scheduled time |
| Starting | :material-play-circle-outline: | Sending to printer |
| Printing | :material-printer-3d: | Currently printing |
| Completed | :material-check-circle:{ style="color: #4caf50" } | Successfully finished |
| Failed | :material-close-circle:{ style="color: #f44336" } | Print failed |
| Cancelled | :material-cancel: | Manually removed |

### Queue Card

Each queued print shows:

- Thumbnail (shows the selected plate's thumbnail for multi-plate files)
- Print name
- Target printer
- Estimated duration
- Scheduled time (if set)
- Status
- Added by (username who queued the print, when authentication is enabled)

---

## :material-cancel: Managing Queue

### Remove from Queue

1. Click the **X** on any queued print
2. Confirm removal
3. Print is removed (not deleted from archive)

### Cancel Running Print

1. Find the currently printing item
2. Click **Cancel**
3. Print stops on printer
4. Marked as cancelled in queue

### Clear Plate Confirmation

When a print finishes or fails and more items are queued for the same printer, the next print does **not** start automatically. Instead, the printer card shows a **"Clear Plate & Start Next"** button.

1. Remove the finished print from the build plate
2. Click **Clear Plate & Start Next** on the printer card
3. The scheduler starts the next queued print within 30 seconds

This prevents prints from starting on a dirty plate. The button appears whenever the printer is in **Finished** or **Failed** state with pending queue items.

!!! tip "Permission Required"
    The Clear Plate button requires the **Printers Control** permission when authentication is enabled.

### Clear Queue

Remove all queued prints:

1. Click **Clear Queue** button
2. Confirm action
3. All pending prints removed

!!! note "Running Print Not Affected"
    Clear Queue only removes pending prints, not the currently active print.

---

## :material-pencil-box-multiple: Bulk Editing

Edit multiple queued items at once:

### Selecting Items

1. Look for checkboxes on pending queue items
2. Click checkbox to select/deselect individual items
3. Use **Select All** / **Deselect All** in the toolbar

### Bulk Edit Modal

When items are selected, click **Edit Selected** to open the bulk edit modal:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Printer** | Reassign all selected items to a different printer |
| **Staged** | Toggle manual start (Queue Only) mode |
| **Auto power off** | Toggle auto power off after print |
| **Require previous success** | Toggle conditional execution |
| **Bed levelling** | Toggle bed levelling |
| **Flow calibration** | Toggle flow calibration |
| **Vibration calibration** | Toggle vibration calibration |
| **First layer inspection** | Toggle AI inspection |
| **Timelapse** | Toggle timelapse recording |
| **Use AMS** | Toggle AMS usage |

### Tri-State Toggles

Each setting has three states:

| State | Symbol | Meaning |
|-------|:------:|---------|
| **Unchanged** | — | Don't modify this setting |
| **Off** | Off | Set to disabled on all selected items |
| **On** | On | Set to enabled on all selected items |

Only settings you explicitly change are applied - other settings remain as they were.

### Bulk Cancel

Click **Cancel Selected** to cancel all selected pending items at once.

!!! tip "Quick Reassignment"
    Use bulk edit to quickly reassign multiple prints to a different printer when one becomes unavailable.

---

## :material-printer: Multi-Printer Queue

Queue prints across multiple printers:

### Per-Printer Queues

Each printer has its own queue:

- Filter by printer to see specific queue
- Prints wait for their assigned printer
- Different printers can print simultaneously

### Multi-Printer Selection

Send the same print to multiple printers at once:

1. Open **Add to Queue** or **Re-print** modal
2. Select multiple printers using checkboxes
3. Use **Select all** / **Clear** buttons for quick selection
4. Configure filament mapping (default applies to all printers, or use per-printer mapping)
5. Click submit to send to all printers

!!! tip "Print Farms"
    Multi-printer selection is ideal for print farms. Use the default mapping for printers with identical filament configurations, or enable per-printer mapping for mixed setups.

### Per-Printer AMS Mapping

When multiple printers are selected, you can configure filament slot mapping individually for each printer:

1. Select multiple printers
2. Under each printer, check **Custom mapping** to enable per-printer configuration
3. The mapping section expands showing:
   - Required filaments with color indicators
   - Dropdown to select AMS slot for each requirement
   - Match status: :material-check:{ style="color: #00ae42" } exact, :material-alert:{ style="color: #facc15" } type-only, :material-alert:{ style="color: #f97316" } missing
4. Click **Auto** to auto-configure using RFID data
5. Click **Re-read** to refresh the printer's loaded filaments

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Custom mapping** checkbox | Enable per-printer slot configuration |
| **Auto** button | Auto-match filaments using RFID data |
| **Re-read** button | Refresh loaded filaments from printer |
| Match indicator | Shows (X/Y matched) status |

!!! tip "Default Expanded"
    Go to **Settings → Filament** and enable **Expand custom mapping by default** to automatically expand per-printer mapping for all printers when multi-selecting.

!!! note "Auto-Configure"
    The Auto button reads RFID data from loaded spools and matches them to required filaments by type and color. It prioritizes exact matches, then similar colors, then type-only matches.

### Choosing a Printer

When adding to queue:

1. Select one or more target printers
2. Prints join each printer's queue
3. Different archives can go to different printers

### Load Balancing

Manually distribute prints:

- Add long prints to less-used printers
- Queue time-sensitive prints on fastest printer
- Keep specific materials on specific printers
- Use multi-printer selection for batch production

---

## :material-printer-3d-nozzle: Model-Based Queue Assignment

Queue prints to "any printer of matching model" for automatic load balancing across identical printers.

### How It Works

1. When you add a print to the queue, select **Any [Model]** instead of a specific printer
2. Optionally select a **Location** to further filter available printers (e.g., "Any X1C in Workshop")
3. Bambuddy extracts the printer model from the sliced 3MF file (e.g., "X1C", "P1S")
4. The scheduler automatically assigns the print to the first idle printer of that model (and location, if specified)
5. If filament validation is enabled, it only assigns to printers with the required filaments loaded

### Adding Model-Based Queue Items

1. Open **Add to Queue** modal
2. In the printer selection, choose **Any X1C**, **Any P1S**, etc.
3. Optionally select a **Location** from the dropdown to filter by printer location
4. Configure other options as usual
5. Submit - the print joins the queue without a specific printer

### Location Filtering

When you have multiple printers of the same model in different locations:

1. Choose **Any [Model]** for the printer
2. Select a **Location** from the dropdown (shows all locations from your printers)
3. The scheduler only considers printers at that location
4. Queue items show the target location (e.g., "Any X1C - Workshop")

!!! tip "Filtering Queue by Location"
    On the Queue page, use the **Location** dropdown filter to view only jobs for a specific location.

### Filament Validation

When a model-based queue item has required filaments:

1. Scheduler checks each printer of the matching model
2. Only printers with all required filament types loaded (in AMS or external spool) are considered
3. Jobs wait until a compatible printer becomes available
4. The **Waiting** status (purple badge) shows why a job is waiting

### Filament Override

When using model-based assignment, you can override the filament colors and types from the original 3MF file:

1. Select **Any [Model]** for the printer
2. The **Filament Override** section appears showing each filament slot from the sliced file
3. For each slot, a dropdown shows all compatible filaments loaded across printers of the selected model
4. Select an override to change the color or type for that slot
5. Click the reset button to revert to the original 3MF value

The scheduler uses the overridden values when matching filaments:

- **Color preference**: Printers with exact color matches for your overrides are preferred
- **Type filtering**: Only filaments of the same type are shown in the dropdown (e.g., PLA slots only show PLA)
- **Nozzle-aware**: On dual-nozzle printers (H2D), only filaments on the correct extruder are shown

!!! tip "Use Case"
    You sliced a model in black PLA but want to print it in white PLA instead. Rather than re-slicing, override the filament color in the queue and the scheduler will find a printer with white PLA loaded.

### Waiting Status

Model-based queue items show detailed status:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pending** | Ready to start, waiting for idle printer |
| **Waiting** | Blocked - shows reason (e.g., "Waiting for filament: Printer1 (needs PLA)") |
| **Printing** | Assigned to printer and running |

The waiting reason tells you exactly what's needed:

- **Waiting for filament**: Which printers are missing which filament types
- **Busy**: Which printers are currently printing
- **Offline**: Which printers are disconnected

### Compatibility Warnings

When queuing to a specific printer that doesn't match the sliced model:

- A warning shows "File was sliced for X1C, but printing on P1S"
- This helps avoid issues from mismatched print profiles

!!! tip "Print Farm Load Balancing"
    Model-based assignment is ideal for print farms with multiple identical printers. Queue prints to "Any X1C" and let Bambuddy distribute work automatically.

## :material-bell-ring: Queue Notifications

Get notified about queue events. Configure these in **Settings → Notifications** under "Print Queue":

| Event | Default | Description |
|-------|:-------:|-------------|
| **Job Added** | Off | Job added to queue |
| **Job Assigned** | Off | Model-based job assigned to a printer |
| **Job Started** | Off | Queue job started printing |
| **Job Waiting** | On | Job waiting for filament (actionable) |
| **Job Skipped** | On | Job skipped due to previous print failure |
| **Job Failed** | On | Job failed to start (upload error, etc.) |
| **Queue Complete** | Off | All queued jobs finished |

!!! tip "Actionable Notifications"
    The most important notifications (Waiting, Skipped, Failed) are enabled by default because they require user action. Enable others based on your monitoring needs.

[:material-arrow-right: Set up notifications](notifications.md)

## :material-history: Queue History

View past queue activity:

- Completed prints
- Failed prints
- Cancelled prints
- Execution times

History helps you:

- Track throughput
- Identify patterns
- Debug issues

---

## :material-api: API Access

Manage queue programmatically:

```bash
# Add to queue
POST /api/v1/queue

# Get queue status
GET /api/v1/queue

# Remove from queue
DELETE /api/v1/queue/{id}
```

See [API Reference](../reference/api.md) for details.

---

## :material-upload: Background Print Dispatch

When you start a print — whether from an archive (Reprint), the file manager, or the print queue — the FTP upload and print-start command run in the background. The UI responds immediately and you can continue browsing while the file transfers.

### Progress Tracking

A persistent toast notification shows real-time dispatch progress:

- **Upload progress bar** for each active job
- **Status badges**: Dispatched → Processing → Completed / Failed / Cancelled
- **Cancel button** to abort an in-progress upload (cleans up partial files on the printer)
- **Batch progress** (e.g., "2/3 complete") when dispatching to multiple printers

### How It Works

1. You click **Print** or **Reprint** — the API returns immediately with a dispatch job ID
2. The background dispatcher picks up the job and starts the FTP upload
3. Progress updates stream to all connected clients via WebSocket
4. After upload completes, the dispatcher sends the print-start command to the printer
5. If you cancel mid-upload, the partial file is deleted from the printer's SD card

!!! info "Per-Printer Queuing"
    Each printer can only have one active dispatch at a time. If you send a second print to the same printer, it waits until the first completes. Different printers run concurrently.

---

## :material-lightbulb: Tips

!!! tip "Overnight Prints"
    Schedule longer prints to start overnight - wake up to finished prints!

!!! tip "Smart Plug Combo"
    Combine scheduling with auto power-off for hands-free operation.

!!! tip "Queue Batch Jobs"
    Queue multiple small prints for efficient batch production.

!!! tip "Priority Management"
    Move urgent prints to the top of the queue with drag-and-drop.

!!! tip "Estimated Times"
    Check estimated durations when scheduling to avoid printer conflicts.

!!! tip "Auto-Drying Between Prints"
    Enable [queue auto-drying](ams.md#queue-auto-drying) to automatically dry filament during idle gaps between scheduled prints. For printers without scheduled prints, [ambient drying](ams.md#ambient-drying) keeps filament dry on any idle printer automatically.
