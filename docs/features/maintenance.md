## :material-lightbulb: Maintenance Tips

!!! tip "Bed Cleaning"
    Clean with IPA between prints for best adhesion. Deep clean with dish soap weekly.

!!! tip "Lubrication"
    Use appropriate grease for linear rails. Don't over-lubricate.

!!! tip "Belt Tension"
    Belts should be firm but not overly tight. Use the "guitar string" test.

!!! tip "Nozzle Inspection"
    Check for wear, especially with abrasive filaments. Replace when worn.

!!! tip "Filters"
    HEPA and carbon filters lose effectiveness over time. Replace as recommended.

!!! tip "Document Everything"
    Add notes when logging maintenance to build a history of what works.
