1. Enable **Quiet Hours** toggle

## :material-lightbulb: Tips

!!! tip "Start with ntfy"
    ntfy is the simplest setup - no account needed, just pick a topic.

!!! tip "Use Quiet Hours"
    Avoid middle-of-night alerts with quiet hours.

!!! tip "Multiple Providers"
    Set up multiple providers for redundancy.

!!! tip "Progress for Long Prints"
    Enable progress milestones for prints over a few hours.

!!! tip "Customize Templates"
    Personalize messages to include only info you need.

!!! tip "Test Regularly"
    Periodically test notifications to ensure they still work.

!!! tip "Bed Cooled Threshold"
    Configure the bed cooled temperature threshold in **Settings** > **Notifications**. Default is 35°C. The bed is polled every 15 seconds after a print completes, with a 30-minute timeout.

!!! tip "Plate Not Empty Bypasses Quiet Hours"
    Plate detection notifications are always sent immediately, even during quiet hours or when digest mode is enabled. This ensures you're alerted to potential issues before a print starts.
